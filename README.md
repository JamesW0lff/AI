# VGP332 - Multiple Projects

## Multiple functional projects in C++ that include basic Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) coded in XEngine**. 
# This project includes: 
  * Direct  XTK for graphics. 
  * ImgGui for graphical interface and testing purposes.

Here you can find different projects which use simple A.I. for games.

*  Steering - Project meant to represent A.I. as patrolling certain area.
*  Pathfinding - Project that includes different ways to follow an objective with a starting point A to final point B. The project includes different pathfindgins which are the following:
  * Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  * Depth First Search (DFS)
  * Dijkstra's Algorithm
  * A* Search algorithm (Diagonal/ Euclidean)
*  State Machine

** IMPORTANT NOTE: XEngine files were not developed by myself.
